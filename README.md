# Drone Simulator
I am simulating a drone using OpenGL. The movement of the drone is computed using the Newton Laws by the speed of four blades.
This version shows a still drone which you can only change the rotation speed of the leaves. Keyboard control instructions are not well written. This program also features rotating and zooming the scene by mouse drag and scroll. There are a significant part of code credit to Sam Buss. The program is provided as-is with no warranty. Please use them with caution.
